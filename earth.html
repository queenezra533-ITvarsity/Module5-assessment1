                    Earth is the only planet not named after a god.
                    The other seven planets in our solar system are all named after Roman gods or goddesses.<br>
                     Although only Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were named during ancient times,<br>
                      because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman method of naming planets was retained <br>
                      after the discovery of Uranus and Neptune.
