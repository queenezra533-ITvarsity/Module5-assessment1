                    Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system – only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. 
                </p>             

                <p>
                    Mercury is the planet that orbits the closest to the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system –<br>
                     traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. <br>
                     The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. <br>
                     Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun,<br>
                     it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system – 88 days.
                </p>
